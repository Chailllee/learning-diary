title: "Week7 - Classification and Accuracy"
---

## Abstract

Here is the overview of remote sensing techniques for classifying and assessing the accuracy of land cover data. Here are the key points:

-   **Landcover Classification**: It discusses the use of pre-classified data sources like GlobeLand30, ESA’s CCI, Dynamic World, MODIS, and Google building data for landcover classification.

-   **Dynamic World**: The page details the process of training, pre-processing, normalization, and classification using CNNs, with a focus on Dynamic World’s semi-supervised approach and regional division for sample stratification.

-   **Sub Pixel Analysis**: It explains the concept of sub pixel classification, spectral mixture analysis, and linear spectral unmixing, including mathematical formulas for calculating the proportion of landcover per pixel.

-   **Accuracy Assessment**: The page outlines various accuracy assessment methods in remote sensing, such as producer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, overall accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient, along with their definitions and significance.
