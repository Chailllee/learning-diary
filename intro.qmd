title: "Week1 - Introduction of RS"
---

## Beginning

Before starting this course, I need to first understand the purpose of this course, which is to introduce the basic concepts and applications of remote sensing, and through this course of RS, the content we will learn includes:

-   Definition, classification and platform of remote perception

-   Interaction of electromagnetic waves with the Earth's surface

-   Four resolutions for remote sensing data: spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiative

-   Format, selection, and limitations of remote sensing data

-   Practical cases and analysis methods of remote perception data

It easily reminds me of the basic concepts of RS that I learned by myself during my undergraduate study. I believe that this course can not only help me review the past knowledge, but also fully supplement other knowledge.

## Summary of this class

-   **Tele-sensing Cities and Environments:** This is a course that introduces the basic principles and applications of tele-sensing, with a focus on urban and environmental issues.

-   **Types and principles of remote sensing:** Remote sensing is divided into active and passive, depending on whether it has its own energy transmitter. Remote sensing data is affected by the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the atmosphere and the surface, and needs to be corrected and processed.

-   **Format and resolution of remote sensing data:** Remote sensing data is usually raster data and has different storage formats and ways of organizing. The quality and application of remote sensing data are constrained by spatial, spectral, temporal and radiative resolution.

## Basic concepts and principles of remote sensing

### The difference between passive and active sensors

The difference between the two is that passive sensors are affected by atmospheric scattering and need to work when light conditions are good, while active sensors can penetrate clouds, volcanic ash and atmospheric conditions and can work at night.

| For the untrained eye, it’s just a bunch of black and white pixels. But the reality is that there’s more than meets the eye. For example, the 3 main types of backscatter are: Specular reflection Double-bounce Diffuse scattering                                                                                                                       | Passive remote sensing can be very similar to how our eyes interpret the world. But the power of passive remote sensing is to see light in the whole [electromagnetic spectrum](https://gisgeography.com/multispectral-vs-hyperspectral-imagery-explained/){style="blue"}. For example, this multispectral image can have different band combinations like color infrared. |

### The relation between electromagnetic wave and multispectrum

According to the frequency of electromagnetic wave vibration, the electromagnetic spectrum can be divided into visible spectrum and invisible electromagnetic spectrum two parts.

Multispectral remote sensing refers to the remote sensing observation and research of ground targets in multiple spectral bands. These bands can include infrared, visible, near-infrared, etc. By analyzing the information of these different bands, more information about the ground target can be obtained.

In general, the relationship between electromagnetic wave and multi-spectrum is that multi-spectral remote sensing uses different bands of electromagnetic wave, and more information of ground targets can be obtained by analyzing the information of these bands.
